    "The goal of this homework is to explore retrieval-augmented in-context learning. This is an exciting area that brings together a number of recent task ideas and modeling innovations. We will use the [DSPy programming library](http://dspy.ai) to build systems in this new mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our core task is __open-domain question answering (OpenQA)__. In this task, all that is given by the dataset is a question text, and the task is to answer that question. By contrast, in many modern QA tasks, the dataset provides a text and a gold passage, usually with a firm guarantee that the answer will be a substring of the passage.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenQA is substantially harder than standard QA. The usual strategy is to use a _retriever_ to find passages in a large collection of texts and train a _reader_ to find answers in those passages. This means we have no guarantee that the retrieved passage will contain the answer we need. If we don't retrieve a passage containing the answer, our reader has no hope of succeeding. Although this is challenging, it is much more realistic and widely applicable than standard QA. After all, with the right retriever, an OpenQA system could be deployed over the entire Web.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task posed by this homework is harder even than OpenQA. We are calling this task __few-shot OpenQA__. The defining feature of this task is that the reader is simply a frozen, general purpose language model. It accepts string inputs (prompts) and produces text in response. It is not trained to answer questions per se, and nothing about its structure ensures that it will respond with a substring of the prompt corresponding to anything like an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Few-shot QA__ (but not OpenQA!) is explored in the famous GPT-3 paper ([Brown et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)). The authors are able to get traction on the problem using GPT-3, an incredible finding. Our task here – __few-shot OpenQA__ – pushes this even further by retrieving passages to use in the prompt rather than assuming that the gold passage can be used in the prompt. If we can make this work, then it should be a major step towards flexibly and easily deploying QA technologies in new domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Just to repeat: your mission is to explore the final line in this table. The core notebook and assignment don't address the issue of training the retriever in a task-specific way, but this is something you could pursue for a final project; [the ColBERT codebase](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) makes easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a requirement of the bake-off that a general-purpose language model be used. In particular, trained QA systems cannot be used at all, and no fine-tuning is allowed either. See the original system question at the bottom of this message for guidance on which models are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the models we are working with here are _big_. This poses a challenge that is increasingly common in NLP: you have to pay one way or another. You can pay to use the GPT-3 API, or you can pay to use a local model on a heavy-duty cluster computer, or you can pay with time by using a local model on a more modest computer."
